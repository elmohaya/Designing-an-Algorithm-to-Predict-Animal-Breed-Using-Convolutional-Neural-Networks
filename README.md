# Designing an Algorithm to Predict Animal Breed Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This is the second project in the Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity. In this project, we designed an algorithm to detect a dog breed using convolutional neural networks, which can be . First, we designed a model from scratch and test its accuracy. In the next stage, we applied the concepts of transfer learning and used the [VGG16](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) model. By doing that, our model attained 86% accuracy in detecting a dog breed. This repository contains the following files:

- designing_dog_app.ipynb --- This is the jupyter notebook file in which the algorithm was designed through.

- designing_dog_app.html  --- This is an HTML version of the jupyter notebook.

- Images                  --- This folder contains the images presented through the notebook.
